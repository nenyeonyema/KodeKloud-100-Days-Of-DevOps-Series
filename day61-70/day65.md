# Task 65

> The Nautilus application development team observed some performance issues with one of the application that is deployed in Kubernetes cluster. After looking into number of factors, the team has suggested to use some in-memory caching utility for DB service. After number of discussions, they have decided to use Redis. Initially they would like to deploy Redis on kubernetes cluster for testing and later they will move it to production. Please find below more details about the task:
>
> Create a redis deployment with following parameters:
>
> Create a config map called my-redis-config having maxmemory 2mb in redis-config.
>
> Name of the deployment should be redis-deployment, it should use
> redis:alpine image and container name should be redis-container. Also make sure it has only 1 replica.
>
> The container should request for 1 CPU.
>
> Mount 2 volumes:
>
> * An Empty directory volume called data at path /redis-master-data.
>
> * A configmap volume called redis-config at path /redis-master.
>
> * The container should expose the port 6379.
>
> inally, redis-deployment should be in an up and running state.
Note: The kubectl utility on jump_host has been configured to work with the kubernetes cluster.

### Redis Deployment with ConfigMap, EmptyDir & Resource Requests

1. Create ConfigMap (my-redis-config)
Contains: `maxmemory 2mb`

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: my-redis-config
data:
  redis-config: |
    maxmemory 2mb
```

2. Create Redis Deployment (redis-deployment)

```
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: redis-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: redis
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: redis
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: redis-container
          image: redis:alpine
          resources:
            requests:
              cpu: "1"
          ports:
            - containerPort: 6379
          volumeMounts:
            - name: data
              mountPath: /redis-master-data
            - name: redis-config
              mountPath: /redis-master
      volumes:
        - name: data
          emptyDir: {}
        - name: redis-config
          configMap:
            name: my-redis-config
            items:
              - key: redis-config
                path: redis.conf
```

Apply the YAML
Save it as redis.yaml then run:
```
kubectl apply -f redis.yaml
```
**Verify Deployment is Running**
```
kubectl get pods
kubectl describe pod -l app=redis
```

*Check container logs:*
```
kubectl logs -l app=redis
```
